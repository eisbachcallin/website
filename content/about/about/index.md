### Artists

#### Miso

Munich-born DJ and producer Miso discovered his love for drum n' bass in London's nightlife. Inspired by the hard
rhythms and screaming basslines of the city, he is dedicated to a mix of everything the genre has to offer. Whether
vocal-based, break-heavy or just groovy, nothing is safe from his three decks and is promptly served with plenty of
bass.

#### Noise Colors

Two passionate musicians and producers from Munich, Germany, have joined forces to create a fresh Drum & Bass and
Dubstep project: "Noise Colors". Their live trademark - two Mixers with three turntables - has proven itself on numerous
occasions. Supporting artists like "Mind Vortex" and playing regularly at plenty of local venues such as "The Drum &
Bass Issue", "Isar Bass", "Clandestino Rave", "Neokeller" and "Eisbach Callin'", they build up their reputation as one
of Munich's freshest electronic acts.

#### Turdbaby

Turdbaby takes you on a colorful journey through all varieties of bass music, be it soulful garage, gritty dubstep,
uptempo kuduro, brostep, or almighty jungle; simply an eclectic mix of everything that can lead to the fringes of
breakcore and dark dub - anything goes, as long as the rave is in ruins afterwards!

#### Weiky

Sweet, full of vitamins and somehow mysterious: The live sets of Munich DJ Weiky are as exotic and intoxicating as the
fruit. It's no secret; just take one part each of Techno, Tech House and Minimal Techno, mix it with a pinch of humor
and self-irony and the result is a dish that makes you dance until dawn: Weiky.

#### VisionÃ¤r

Munich-based visualist VisionÃ¤r casts a colorful universe on the wall, a flowing journey through music using a mix of
inputs. Whether street scenes, distorted beyond recognition in an ecstatic rush of color or shining pale behind a
filter; whether Soviet cartoons, Hungarian Magarin advertisements, or Murnau's Nosferatu: with an attitude between love
of detail and chutzpah, everything is shredded, reassembled, clothed and sent onto the stage. Basically, whatever is at
hand can be blasted through the digital ether and into the audience's optic nerves. So even the audience itself, a
half-empty beer bottle, yesterday's newspaper or just the way to the bakery can morph into a flashing blazing inferno of
shapes and colors.
