A night of Drum&Bass, Breaks, Dubstep, and HipHop at Munichs longest-running underground party:

Drums are pounding, bass is thumping, and the floor is shaking! The Eisbach Callin crew invites you to a dance floor duel like no other, as the mighty Pressurized crew descends onto Munich to face off in a DnB Battle for the ages. Get ready for a night of high-energy beats, relentless bass, and non-stop bangers. Close your eyes and imagine a place where sound is a river, and its waves are the heartbeat of the city. That place is Eisbach Callin. Join us as we welcome Pressurized, one of the most vibrant and longest running crews from Nuremberg, for a journey to the heart of sound. A night where the bass is the lifeblood and the beats are the heartbeat. A night where sound becomes reality, and reality becomes sound.

As always, Eisbach callin will be hosted by legendary MC Irie Treasure with visuals by VJ Visionär.

Don’t act like a clown, dance like one!
