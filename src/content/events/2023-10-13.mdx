A night of Drum&Bass, Breaks, Dubstep, and HipHop at Munichs longest-running underground party:

Eisbach Callin Presents SKS

Get ready to witness the talent of SKS, the renowned owner of Vandal Records and Vandal Ltd. Hailing all the way from France, Vandal Records has been a driving force in the Drum & Bass scene since its inception in 2004, dedicated to delivering dancefloor devastation like no other. This isn't just another party; it's a testament to the power of underground music and the relentless spirit of Eisbach Callin.

As always, Eisbach callin will be hosted by legendary MC Irie Treasure with visuals by VJ Visionär.  
Don't act like a clown, dance like one!
